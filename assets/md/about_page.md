# About Sokoban

**Sokoban** (Japanese for *"warehouse keeper"*) is a classic puzzle game originally created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi.
It quickly gained worldwide popularity for its simple rules yet highly challenging gameplay.
Over the years, Sokoban has become a staple in the puzzle genre and inspired countless variations and adaptations across platforms.

## How to Play

In Sokoban, you play as a warehouse worker whose goal is to push boxes (or crates) onto designated storage locations.
The challenge lies in maneuvering the crates without getting them stuck in unreachable positions.

### Rules:
1. The player can **move up, down, left, or right** within the warehouse grid.
2. The player can **push boxes** by moving into them, but **cannot pull** them.
3. Only one box can be pushed at a time.
4. The level is complete when **all boxes are placed on the designated goals** (often marked as dots or special tiles).
5. If a box is pushed into a corner or against a wall where it can no longer be moved, the level may become **unsolvable**, requiring a restart.

### Objective:
1. Carefully plan each move to **avoid deadlocks** (irreversible mistakes).
2. Use strategy and foresight to place each box onto its target.
3. Solve the puzzle with the **least number of moves** for a perfect score.

## Beginner Guide

When you first begin playing Sokoban, it’s a good idea to start with some of the easier levels rather than diving straight into the more difficult ones.
By tackling simpler puzzles at the beginning, you can gradually familiarize yourself with the basic mechanics and develop effective strategies for solving the challenges.
This step-by-step approach allows you to build up your skills at a comfortable pace while also helping you gain confidence as you progress.
Over time, as you master the fundamentals, you’ll be better prepared to take on the more complex and demanding levels that truly test your problem-solving abilities.
